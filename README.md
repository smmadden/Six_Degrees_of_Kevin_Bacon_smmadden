# CS 245 Assignment 02: Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon

Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon​ is a knowledge game based on the “small world” or “six degrees of separation” concept. It is possible for a large network to be linked by a limited number of steps through one or more who are well-connected. As it turns out, Kevin Bacon may be less prolific than others — Meryl Streep or Ben Kingsley, for example — so this game may belie the biases of the inventors.
